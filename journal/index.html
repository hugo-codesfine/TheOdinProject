        <h1>Dev Journal: The Odin Project</h1>
        <h4L>16th April, 2024</h4L>
        <p>I took some time without studying. Like always life happened. However since a couple of 
            days ago I've been wanting to get back to it.
        </p>
        <p>My main motivation has been an urge to learn so I can do projects and collaborate with others
            I am really interested in supporting TheOdinProject; yesterday I discovered that they have 
            open issues that you can be assigned to in order to fix or improve the curriculum!
            Also I look forward to collaborate in other open source projects... Can't wait to support MigraCode
            in that sense. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I know AmpleNote and Raycast are not Open Source, but also is very motivating the idea of developin
            plugins or extensions for apps that I use on a daily basis ðŸ¤©!
        </p>
        <p>
            And of course the white whale of all, the final test, the ultimate objective... UBPM. Can't wait for the moment
            I get to actually have an app for that...
